Definition of software

DecorGlass is an interior design preview software that uses AR<sup>1</sup> technology. The purpose of this software is to allow potential buyers to preview their chosen furniture in their chosen location before purchasing said item. The user is able to browse through numerous amounts of interior design related items provided by various companies and/or designers. The application retrieves various 3D models of furniture uploaded by vendors around the world through the Internet. DecorGlass alters the reality of the surroundings through the smart device to give the users an idea of how the environment will look. The application can be used for viewing the furniture in certain environments or surroundings without having to pay for the item. By using the software with smart glasses, users can build their surroundings in their own preferred manner.  The app gives the user an option to save their data locally or by using DecorGlass cloud services. 
 
DecorGlass will not require the user login to use it, however, the software will provide the login feature for customers who might want to save certain settings or designs. It is also to be mentioned that DecorGlass is a third-party app and will not have a web store of its own. If the users decide to buy specific furniture, the software will redirect them to the web store of said company where the users will need to abide by their conditions and terms.
