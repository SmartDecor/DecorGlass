# Usability

Our team has compiled a list of other similar applications and we weigh the importance of some features. Through this, we can evaluate on which aspect which are important and enhance the performance for the ease of use to our users.

Through many meetings, we have decided that the application should be attractive yet simple and easy to the eyes. It requires all the vital information which are kept organized throughout the application. 

The welcome page will guide the user to login with their credentials or they can just jump straight into using the application if they so choose. As they navigate through the application, they are presented with wide varieties of appliances. If they have previously accessed the application, it will showcase certain appliances that they might be interested in.

They are plenty of appliances which are categorized for easy usability experience. 

During registration,  general users will be prompted a unique username, password that they can choose to access in the future. The app requires the user to be verified by prompting to key in a valid email address. 

To be a designer or someone who can contribute their appliances to DecorGlass for other users, they will have to send their credentials and other verification to the administrator for approval. This can be done by email or slow-mail.


# Realibility
We value our users and their rights to keep their information private. Their credentials are well encrypted in our database behind protected state of the art servers and they are well monitored by advance security features. Since the application does not have any monetary transaction as they will be redirected to the webstore of the specific appliances, they will not be required to key in any bank information into the system.

To purchase any product, the user will first have to login their information into the application. Their cart will be they filled with whatever they have chosen previously. When they choose to purchase, they will be redirected to the specific webstore which they would require their personal bank information. Any failure of purchase through the webstore will not have any affect to the application. The users are then advised to contact the webstore to straighten out any unfortunate events.

In the event of an incorrect username or password, the user will be given the option to retrieve a new password through their email that they have keyed in when they first logged in into the application. This will provide another level of security feature. If the user of the application is unable to verify, they will then be allowed to just use the application similar to other unregistered users.


# Efficiency
Our goal is to have the user feeling pleasant after using our application. This requires quick and fast response within the system to allow browsing through the various appliances feeling at ease and the user having a smooth experience throughout. Our application heavily demands the use of internet connection to get information of various vendors. However, we cannot always rely on a good internet connection every time we are outdoors. We have decided that our application will constantly gather some information and store it temporarily in the smart device to ease the users frustration during regrettable downtime period. The same principle as buffering in a video when watching it on a web browser. After the application is no longer in used, the gathered information will be deleted immediately. The application does not use a lot of memory from the smart device. This is to maximize the user experience when using the application during unfortunate circumstances. 

The processing size of the application can be minimize to take into consideration of other applications the user is using. The sizes of the pictures will always be kept small during the browsing period. When the user decides on viewing the product, they would just have to tap on their device and the higher resolution picture of the product will be immediately downloaded through their smart devices. This is to ensure that the usage of  the connection speed is being maximize and will prevent unnecessary bandwidth downloads when using the application.

During the viewing of the appliances in the virtual environment, the information of the environment can be either be stored in the userâ€™s smart device or DecorGlass cloud services. Users are not restricted to a static place when navigating and viewing their desired layout of the room in the virtual environment. They can be on the move while accessing the information to assist them in their purchase.
