### Self Reflection

##### Time spent on the project per person:
  Banafsheh: 16h
  Al-Hafeez: 15h
  Leo:

We divided the workload equally and everyone was active in participation. During the discussions we always took track of time and took notes, therefore the estimated time was not far off from the real time spent doing the project.
