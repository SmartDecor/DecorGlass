### Self Reflection

##### Time spent on the project per person:
  Banafsheh: 16h <br/>
  Al-Hafeez: 15h <br/>
  Leo: 15h <br/>


We divided the workload equally and everyone was active in participation. During the discussions we always took track of time and took notes, therefore the estimated time was not far off from the real time spent doing the project. 
In our next project we aim to have clearer goals and more structured workload. 
Yes, we are actually quite interested to see how only product would be implemented in the real world.
The most challenging thing for this project was to transfer our ideas into words. We first had so many ideas that we were keen on doing however we were able to decided on one. 
We had to think thoroughly through each small little details of the application and analyze every aspects to see if it compatible with our application.
We would grade ourselves based on our good communication, group work and the effort that we put into this project.
