##### Time spent on the project per person:
  Banafsheh: 16h <br/>
  Al-Hafeez: 15h <br/>
  Leo: 15h <br/>

We had to think thoroughly through each small details of the application and analyze every aspects to see if it compatible with our application.
We would grade ourselves based on our good communication, group work and the effort that we put into this project.
